# Workout-Budz
The team consists of Kevin White, Gary Sanchez, Richard Long, and Katrine Collins, also known as KW, GS, RL, and KC for note taking purposes. Our group challenge 2 is: A responsive webpage that allows the user to create a profile, generate a workout using a RESTful API, save the workout to your page, and sign up for other workouts posted.

The repository was set up by GS and cloned by KW, RL, and KC. KC found two APIs and added the workout API to the code. KW, RS, RL, and KC went through the code to change the appropriate routes so the site would work when deployed. KW created the delete workout button. GS created the page that the workout animations are shown on. RL worked on the CSS "look" for the page. Many trial and error attemps were made thought development. 

To utilize the website. The user will need to create a profile through the log in prompt, create a workout, and post it.  The user will also be able to join other workouts that other users have posted. By creating a workout five random exercises are pulled from the API and then populated on the page sa the user's personal workout. The possibilities are endless.
